# delete-empty [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/delete-empty.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delete-empty) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/delete-empty.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/delete-empty) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/delete-empty.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete-empty)

> Recursively delete all empty folders in a directory and child directories.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install delete-empty --save
```

## Usage

```js
var deleteEmpty = require('delete-empty');
```

## API

Given the following directory structure, the **highlighted directories** would be deleted.

```diff
foo/
└─┬ a/
- ├── aa/
  ├─┬ bb/
  │ └─┬ bbb/
  │   ├── one.txt
  │   └── two.txt
- ├─┬ cc/
- │ └── ccc/
- ├ b/
- └ c/
```

**async**

```js
deleteEmpty('foo/', function(err, deleted) {
  console.log(deleted);
  //=> ['foo/aa/', 'foo/a/cc/', 'foo/b/', 'foo/c/']
});
```

**sync**

```js
deleteEmpty.sync('foo/');
```

As with the async method, an array of deleted directories is returned, in case you want to log them out or provide some kind of feedback to the user.

```js
var deleted = deleteEmpty.sync('foo/');
console.log(deleted);
//=> ['foo/aa/', 'foo/a/cc/', 'foo/b/', 'foo/c/']
```
